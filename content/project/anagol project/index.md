summary: Using a difference-in-differences design, I study the differential economic impacts in India at the district level under varying lockdown measures with nightlights data. My results show that districts with strict lockdown rules experienced a 14% greater reduction of nightlights radiance in April and a 24% greater reduction in May relative to districts with loose lockdown rules. Moreover, I document India's sharp transition into the lockdown period using NASA's latest daily nightlights data for a two-week window around the lockdown announcement.
