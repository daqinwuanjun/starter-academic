  focal_point: Smart
summary: I comparatively study the performance of three public macroeconomic monitoring indexes (ADS, CFNAI and WEI) during the Pandemic Recession and find that they all indicate a very deep but also very short recession (trough at May 2020). Using the algorithm of Kalman filter, I construct my own macroeconomic monitoring index with four monthly indicators. As many economic indexes exhibited wild movements during COVID-19, to understand why this happened, I further illustrate two methods for decomposing my economics index into movements of underlying economic indicators.
